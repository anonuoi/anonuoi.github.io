					<h1> Who we are </h1>
					<p class="featured">  
						We started as a small group of undergraduate students in the department of 
						<a href="http://cse.uoi.gr">CSE</a> at <a href="http://uoi.gr">UOI</a>. 
						However, we are continually expanding with new members from the whole institution
						(undergaduate/graduate students and staff). Of course, we are not constrained to the UOI, 
						but we are open to everyone who share the same values and vision with us.
						<br />
						<br />
						You may wondering why we stay anonymous. The primary reason for this is that we simply hate 
						publicity. The secondary reason is that we want to be treated equaly with all others.

					<h1> Our Manifesto </h1>
					<p> 
Please note that the below Manifesto is at a very priamary form. You are welcomed
to propose ideas on how we can improve it, extend it, and make it more consistent
with student needs.
<br />
<br />
Education in Greece is free, so no fees should be paid by students in all 
three levels (primary, secondary, and tertiary) of the education system. 
Unfortunately, this is not happening. Students in all levels of the education 
have been plagued with the illusion that if they don't join paid schools they 
will not be able to pass the exams. This illusion is forcing more and more 
students, especially in the second level, to pay huge amounts of money for 
something that is normally provided free from the state schools. We consider 
this as the leading cause of depreciation of the state education system. 
This depreciation mainly hurts students who are members of low-income families 
and do not have the money to pay for the external schools.
<br />
Sadly, this "bad" culture developed in students of the first two levels of the 
education follows them at the tertiary level too. There is a number of graduate 
students at the Universities who maintain external schools or solve assignments 
by requiring a fee from undergraduate students. With the term "external school" 
we either mean an external institution that employs many graduate students or a 
single person who is paid to solve student assignments. Of course, the maintenance 
of external schools from graduate students of the University is contrary to the 
University's law which clearly states that the solving of course/lab assignments 
with or without payment for undergraduate students of the department and the 
provision of supportive teaching to undergraduate students is prohibited. 
Unfortunately, this law is not justified from individual departments as it should be. 
Thus, many students in order to minimize their reading time resort to such external 
schools for help or to have their assignments solved. External schools also play 
a bad role in final or mid exams. They approach exam invigilators and some times 
pay or employ them in order to let their students cheat. What is more, students 
communicate the exam questions to the external schools by using their mobile 
phone and the later undertake the responsibility to solve them and to communicate 
the answers back to students. The saddest thing here is that all these behaviors some
times happen in front of the department's professors and under their coverage. 
These students cheat and eventually "buy" a higher grade than students who try by 
their own. Wistfully, the whole situation during the exams cuts the legs of Innocent 
students who are studying themselves and do not cheat during the semester or the exams. 
Of course, all the mentioned behaviors are applauded by the most factions. In fact, 
people that belong to certain factions are paid to advertise external schools or receive 
generous discounts.
<br />
Unfortunately, we believe that the above behavior justifies the modern "Greek" and we 
view it as one of the main cause for the Greek Crisis. We also believe, that he Greek 
Crisis is not economical but a crisis of values.
We seek to fight and prevent such behaviors from happening and from "infecting" the 
mind of young people. Of course, we support the healthy help from one student to another. 
By providing healthy help to another student we mean to help him/her to understand a topic 
but not to solve his/her assignments. We aim for a University of values and justice 
in which factions and external schools have no place. We aim for a University that motivates 
its students to learn new things, to do research, and to harmoniously collaborate with each 
other to achieve their goals and to become better people.
